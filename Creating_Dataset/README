In this folder are all the scripts that were used to create and manipulate our dataset.

Art_Style_Transfer_Airplanes.ipynb : Google Colab script (Jupyter notebook) to add the art style randomly to each image and change the image captions. Must include COCO_Airplanes_Art_style_transfer.py in the Colab environment.

COCO_Airplanes_Art_style_transfer.py : Python script with all the code necessary to apply the art style and change the caption. All dependecies that are needed are added within the Colab script.

Compress_Images.py : Script to compress the images while still retaining most of the definition. Useful to handle the dataset and train on it since it will be smaller.

CreateTrainableSet.py : Used to create a folder with the images and a .txt file with all the captions to train our DALL-E model with.

QueryDataset.py : Thouroughly commented code that explains how to query and manipulate our dataset (based off COCO).
